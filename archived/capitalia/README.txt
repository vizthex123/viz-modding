Important Server Info:

NOTE: This pack is for both you and the clients!

By default, the server will be backed up every half hour and will not backup the mining dimension. It will create 3 incremental backups, and keep 5 (should be every 10 or 15 minutes). Edit the AromaBackup config if you want to change this.

You should have a pre-configured server.properties. Change whatever you want, but be sure level-type is set to BIOMESOP.



Player Ranks:
For info about how to change these, check here:
https://help.ftb.team/help/en-gb/7-ftb-utilities/22-ranks

- Member. The default. Can claim 8 chunks and load 2 of them. Can set nicknames and custom colours (though idk how to do that)
- VIP. Can claim 16 chunks and load 4 of them, set 2 homes, and their names will render in lime green.
- Moderator. Can claim 20 chunks and load 5 of them, set 3 homes, and their names with render in cyan. Can use commands.
- Admin. The default rank for Ops. Can claim 24 chunks, load 6 of them, set 3 homes, and their names will render in dark blue. Can use commands.
- Owner. Intended for the server owner(s). Can claim 32 chunks, load 8 of them, set 5 homes, and their names will render in purple. Can use commands.
- And several other special ones, just check ranks.txt in local\ftbutilities


Custom Mod Configs:
By default, Big Reactors have a max size of 16x24 to help mitigate server deaths - though this can be changed if you wish.


Extra Notes:
Each player will start with some basic mail system items from Forestry in addition to the normal starting items. This is so you can set up a basic trade/mail system.

If you don't know how to use it, read the wiki page(s): https://ftb.gamepedia.com/Forestry_Mail

Eh, not really. Just be sure not to have too many chunks loaded and machines running, and maybe remind people that they can use /sethome, /home, /tpa and /rtp

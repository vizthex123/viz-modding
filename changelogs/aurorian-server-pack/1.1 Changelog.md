# Balance changes

The Scrapper is now a bit faster (15 seconds instead of 20)
Crystals no longer break when boosting machinery, but give a lower speed boost
Tinker's Tools now have a max level of 3 and start with 2 modifiers (5 modifiers total after maxing it out)
- Reduced the amount of XP required to level large tools (hammers & whatnot) to 2,500 (was 4,500)

All Cerulean items can now be processed in a Smeltery
Changed the Silentwood Logs -> Chest recipe to give Silentwood Chests
Added recipes to transmute various items into their Aurorian versions

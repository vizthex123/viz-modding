Initial release.


# Changes from Beta 3

## Main changes

Changed the namespace of all my custom tags to `revolution` (was `modpack`)
Fixed my custom datapacks having the wrong pack format
- This doesn't really affect anything, but I'm annoyed that I misread the wiki when I first made them

Enabled the Extractinator
- Processes End Stone, Netherrack, Cobblestone, Gravel, Sand, Dirt, and Ash into varying materials
- Takes 3 seconds per operation, has very low drop rates for most materials, and doesn't use RF
- I might make a Mark II version in the future that uses RF to get improved rates, but managing 2 sets of almost identical recipes would be *very* annoying - so it's just a vague idea for the time being


All the auto-crafters now have a set progression order based on their utility and ability to be automated (order: Quark -> XyCraft/Thermal -> RFTools -> AE2)
Added recipes to process most items from Alex's Caves into other stuff (or at least have some use outside of a few specialized items)
Some recycling recipes I missed now give XP (Essence of Knowledge for Shredder recipes)
- Includes the Saddle, Name Tag, (Cross)bow, Lead, Maps, and all of my Sawmill recipes


Configured Bigger Reactors to be the final stage of power generation
- Reactors can now reach their absolute maximum size (192 x 192 x 256). I have no idea why you'd ever need a 12-chunk reactor, but the option is there.
- Passive reactors (outputs RF) are now 75% effective instead of the default 50%
- Active reactors (outputs heat) are now 200% effective instead of the default 100% (that's thrice as good!)
- Changed the recipes for several components to match their new progression stage
- The actual config options are really complicated, so for now those remain at the defaults - but I will change them whenever I figured out what each setting does


## Bugfixes

Fixed all my multiblock machine recipes not using item chances when they should
Fixed Uranium Ingots being boostable in a Pulverizer
Fixed the Floater recipe not be checkable because I hid Ping-Pong Sponges from REI
Fixed the smelting recipe for Diamond Scrap being in a Blast Furnace


Fixed Galosphere's Silver Blocks having the incorrect mining level
Fixed the RF Cost for Sawmill recipes not matching my intended system on a few recipes
Fixed the recipe for Honey Bottles -> Honey accepting Syrup Bottles
Fixed the Dye Extractor's Redstone -> Red Dye recipe not loading in
Fixed the Shredder recipe for Polymer Plates missing 2 outputs


Fixed the recipe for Bonded Leather using the `forge:leather` tag when it shouldn't
Fixed the recipes for Slime Blocks using the `forge:slimeballs` tag when they shouldn't
Fixed the Multiservo Press recipe for Stick Blocks using the `forge:rods/wooden` tag when it shouldn't
Fixed all the missing tags for items from Silver Birch
- I reported this to the dev and an update was released that fixed it (except for the Shelf Fungus, Leaves, Sapling, Fence, Fence Gate, and all the Shelf Fungus furniture), but I'm claiming credit for doing it first

Uranium Rods now use Iron Rods (was Steel) and Raw Uranium (was Ingots)
Tweaked the Crystal Transmutator recipe for Certus Quartz (uses 8 Xychorium and ouputs 8 items with varying chances)

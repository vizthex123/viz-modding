# Main changes

Fixed the menu to reflect the title change
- Tweaked the design a bit so it looks somewhat nicer

Fixed the Falling Trees mod not working
Re-enabled Marble Cave generation since the [floating blobs bug](https://github.com/MrTJP/ProjectRed/issues/1874) was fixed


Changed some biome stuff:

Oh the Biomes You've Gone are now the most common modded biome (followed by Regoins Unexplored and Biomes o' Plenty)
- It's better to just stick with 1 biome mod, but then it wouldn't be a retro pack (and I already got the scripting and REI categories set, so now I'm in too deep to change it lol. Might hold a vote or something if enough people want me to reduce the biome count though).
Biomes o' Plenty's Overworld biomes are now a bit rarer
- Nether biomes are a bit more common



# Balance changes

The XP version of the Angel Ring now uses 5 XP (was 3)
- Seems like this is a per-second cost, but the config doesn't specify it
The Moss Paste -> Slimeball recipe now requires Phyto-Gro or Fertilizer in the center



# Recipe changes

Added recipes to convert Corundum Blocks into Crystals
Added the missing Azalea Log conversion (Ecologics -> Quark)
Moved the Uranium Rod recipe to the Amalgamation Station
- Made it a bit cheaper due to this
- Removed existing recipes
Removed the Spectragel -> Slimeball recipe
- Added the `forge:slimeballs` tag to Spectragel
The Reactor Coolant Manifold recipe's central item no longer accepts Water Blocks
Changed the recipe for the Sequential Fabricator to ensure a smoother auto-crafting progression
Crafters (from RF Tools) now require Project Tables to upgrade



# Quest changes

Tweaked the rewards for several
Renamed "Extra Storage" to "Upgraded Compressed Storage"
Added quests to make every type of Crafter (all optional)
Added a quest to make Pneumatic Tubes
Added some MFFS quests



# Misc changes

Updated Extra Data Models Trivia Pack
Added the STONEBORN Inventory Tweaks Compat texture pack

All Crafting Tables now have the revolution:crafting_tables tag
- Replaced recipe inputs with this tag

Tweaked the order of REI's crafting categories
- QuarryPlus now appears at the end
- Moved Thermal Extra to appear just after Thermal's machinery

# Radiance Modding Repository
Welcome to the GitHub repository for all of my Minecraft modpacks! (and published scripts)

Mods will have their own seperate repositories (since it's just a bunch of random files).
 
This is where you'll report issues, make suggestions, etc. outside of the [Discord](https://discord.gg/NtwzA6X) (or CurseForge comments).

The files in here will be the configs, default configs (if the pack is for 1.16 or higher), lore, scripts, custom item textures, and a few development notes I've made about whatever project they're for.

*If you would like to provide translations for my ContentTweaker or KubeJS items, please make a [pull request](https://github.com/vizthex123/viz-projects/pulls) or tell me in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/NtwzA6X)*

*If you would like to translate one of my mods, make a pull request on that mod's GitHub page*

# vizthex's Project Repository
The GitHub repository for all of my Minecraft modpacks. Mods will have their own seperate repositories (since it's a bunch of code).
 
From now on, this is where you'll report issues, make suggestions, etc. outside of the Discord (or even CurseForge comments - just **don't** report issues there).

The files in here will be the lore, scripts, custom item textures, default configs (if the pack is for 1.16) and a few development notes I've made about whatever project they're for (each folder is labelled).

*If you would like to provide translations for my ContentTweaker items, please make a [pull request.](https://github.com/vizthex123/viz-projects/pulls) Don't forget to include the lang file(s)!*

*If you would like to translate one of my mods, make a pull request on that mod's page. Don't forget to include the lang file(s)!*
